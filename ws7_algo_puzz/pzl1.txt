Approach to solve


Consider tenth person saying black if black caps are even, else white.(he can view all 9 persons in front)
Say he says black
Now the second person can guess by counting no. of black caps in front of him . ( if odd then he is wearing black cap  as total blacks are even told by first , 
else if he sees even black caps then it must mean he has white cap )
similarly he can guess if 10th person says white initially .

Thus every person can tell his cap after 10th person.
So max 9 people saved
