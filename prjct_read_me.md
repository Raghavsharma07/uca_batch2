## PROJECT NAME : C CRICKET CUP

## MISSION : DESIGNING A BASIC INTERACTIVE GAME 


# PROBLEM 

The project basically aims to provide the user an interactive cricket game as a part of recreation in the tough covid times. Using basic C, the project aims to invoke interest among students about c programming. It tends to keep the user involved in it with simple interaction and updates about the user inputs.

# PROJECT DESCRIPTION

C CRICKET CUP is basically designed as a simple game between user and the system . 

#### TOSS FUNCTION :

It starts with a toss call entered by the user. If he wins it further provides choice to user whether he wants to bat and bowl.

#### BATTING AND BOWLING FUNCTIONS :

These functions repeatedly ask the user to enter a number between 1-6 .
The scoring scheme is implemented through the use of RANDOM function of C ( RAND() ) . If the user's input matches with the number generated he is considered out else he scores the desired runs .
The functions also keep a track of the runs scored and the wickets fallen .
To store the runs and the wickets, GLOBAL scope of variables is put to use. RECURSION is put to use along with WHILE loops and IF ELSE conditions to repeatedly calls these batting and bowling functions again and again.

The func returns the final score as soon as the fall of wickets reaches 10. ( Exit condition )
Finally the score is displayed along with the winner .

# DESIGN :

The project has been designed with basic day to day concepts of C language :
1. RECURSIVE CALLS in batting and bowling function .
2. Using LOOPS to ask users for input while batting and bowling .
3. The most important part of the project involves around the RAND() function of C which simply makes the game competitive between the user and the system.
4. Finally the code computes the winner , and displays the results along with motivating messages to the user .

# GOALS :
1. The project basically aims to provide a recreational activity to students in the form of a cricket game implemented through the day to day language they practice ( C ).
2. The project is desired to prove to students / user that C is not just confined to coding and just those printing statements .
